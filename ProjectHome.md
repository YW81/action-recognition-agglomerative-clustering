Contains several algorithms for action recognition in Matlab.

Supervised methods: K-NN for database matching and for continuous longer duration sequence segmentation.

Unsupervised methods: K-Means and Temporal agglomerative clustering for action sequence segmentation.

Includes MSRAction3D dataset and MOC motion capture dataset from CMU. Average accuracy of algorithms is 80%

Designed for input of skeleton joint position or rotation.
